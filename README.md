# Sub Manny

## Description

Nowadays many people pay for at least one subscription. They provide us with services like meal prep ingredients, music and podcasts, and the TV shows and movies we know and love. But no one likes to be surprised by random price increases. Oftentimes we only notice after reviewing our bank statement and realizing the total is a little less than we expected.
So to save you from the mini heart attack you may experience after thinking hackers got a hold of your account information, we came up with the application Sub Manny! Sub Manny is the website that notifies you when your subscription services raise your plan pricing. And with that information you hopefully won't be surprised by your next bank statement.

## User Story

AS A busy consumer, I WANT to get notified when my subscriptions change prices BEFORE my account is charged. This way I can plan my actions accordingly (e.g. cancel my subscription or ensure I have the funds available to continue my subscription).

## Usage

When users of Sub Manny login or create an account, they are redirected to a personal dashboard. Here, they can add subscriptions to be tracked. Enter a subscription Name, the plan you are currently subscribed to, and that's it! 
When our administrative team is notified of price changes by subscription providers, they will reflect that price change on your dashboard and notify you via the email you used to create your account. 
After you have been informed, it is up to you to access your personal subscription account and either choose to cancel your subscription or continue your subscription plan with the updated pricing.
